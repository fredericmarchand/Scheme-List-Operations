Assignment 2
Prof. Franz Oppacher

I used DrRacket to do this assignment as Prof. Oppacher has told the class to do.

All questions are answered in the file "a2.rkt"
The testing for each question is separated in the the output section (bottom of Dr. Racket)
by labels in the following format: "Question #" 

In the testing section for each question in the code, comments have been added next to each test 
to compare the expected output of each call.

All tests performed in the assignment check the bound cases and a few cases in the middle in order to 
insure the proper answers.
